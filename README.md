## Requirements
- Python
    - I believe at least 3.7 for the features I'm using.
    - I'm running 3.10.12 on my machine
- unittest
    - Install with `pip install unittest`.
    - Run `python -m unittest -v` to run all tests.

## Some conventions
- Vectors are row vectors, that means composition of linear maps goes left to right
- Indexing of variables starts at zero, of course.
- All integer tuples are listed in reverse lex

## To-do
- Bijectivizations allowing zero
